Customers are getting more and more frustrated with the current order tracking status. They don’t know if their package is lost, or when it will be delivered.
</p>
<p>

This way they will always be in touch with their packages in transit or with delivery exceptions!
</p>
<p>
Most likely, you've already adopted 3rd-party couriers to track your packages, but is that really improving the customer experience? Tracking a UPS tracking number on a shipping label doesn't answer the main question - when am I going to receive my order?
</p>
<p>
Fake shipping update statuses and convoluted tracking websites are leading to even more confusion, which leads to even more frustration. Ultimately, these frustrations often result in one of the most common calls that contact centers receive: "Where's my order?". We've got your back with our Magento UPS tracking integration, as well as other major carriers like USPS, FedEx, and DHL, plus over 
</p>
<p>
Rather than sending the typical sales email, send SMS texts to customers with an order's shipping status. Use concise messages about when the package is shipped, how long it takes, and if any shipment exceptions happen.
</p>
<p>
If any of the scenarios mentioned above sound familiar, that means you need a Magento 2 Transactional Emails solution. Today, it is important to have full control over your Magento shipment status and customer tracking experience. Choosing an easy-to-use Magento 2 SMS Extension puts you in the best position possible when serving customers.

<ul>
  <p>
 You’ve just made a sale, but you have no idea if your customer received their order.
</p>
<p>
Your customers are constantly asking you about their orders and it’s becoming a real pain point for them and for your business. Did you know that, on average, 30% of customers contact customer support after receiving their order asking "Where is my order?"
</p>
<p>
Our Magento transactional email extension can help! With our solution, we can automatically send out emails to let them know that their order has been shipped or delivered so they will get exactly what they want when they need it. And as an added bonus, we also include tracking information in the email so that you don't have to worry about telling them where their package is at all times!

<h2>STOP EXPECTING YOUR CUSTOMERS TO CHASE THEIR PACKAGES ON ARCHAIC 3RD PARTY WEBSITES.</h2>
<ul>
<p>
In a perfect world, the post-purchase process would be easy. Create shipment, give out tracking number, and wait for the customer to receive the package. Unfortunately, as anyone in the eCommerce industry will tell you, that is not the case.
</p>
<p>
 The problem with most 3rd party shipping software is they are archaic and expensive to use. It's also frustrating when customers don't get their packages because of poor communication from these systems.
</p>
<p>
 Whenever a person cannot find their Magento shipment email tracking link, they will have to spend a lot of time searching for it on multiple websites.
</p>
<p>
We've built a solution system that integrates directly into your store so you can send real-time updates on where each package is at all times right from your dashboard without having to deal with any 3rd parties or extra fees!

<h2>PROACTIVE NOTIFICATIONS WITH FULLY BRANDED EMAIL & SMS!</h2>
<ul>
<p>
Keeping track of your orders is hard, especially when you need to know the exact delivery time.
</p>
<p>
Since the customers are busy and often don’t have time to check their emails, as well as since they may not always be near a computer when it comes to receiving an email notification about a package delivery – we decided that both Emails & SMS notifications would be the best solution for them. 
</p>
<p>
Our proactive tracking system will help you keep your clients informed! We provide real-time shipping information by both email and SMS based on the Magento shipping tracking number updates. 
</p>
<p>
This way your customers can rest assured knowing that their order has been delivered or is on its way without having to constantly check their inboxes or wait until they get home from work before checking if the package has arrived. In addition, we provide a powerful carrier integration with hundreds of carriers all over the world!

<h2>ORDER TRACKING PAGE WHERE CUSTOMERS CAN QUICKLY FIND ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED</h2>
<p><img src="https://wesupplylabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-min-3.png"></p>
<ul>
  <p>
More than 50% of online shoppers say that receiving proactive tracking information is the most important factor in their purchasing decisions. Optimizing Magento order notifications will help them be kept informed of their package's progress, without forcing them to search for it themselves.
  </p>
  <p>

<h2>MULTI-ITEM ORDER TRACKING FOR SPLIT SHIPMENTS.</h2>
<p><img src="https://wesupplylabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/6-min-3.png"></p>
<ul>
  <p>
If you have a multi-item order, it’s important to let your customers know which items are going into which shipment. Otherwise, they won’t even realize that the second item is on its way!
  </p>
  <p>
When products arrive separately, it can be confusing for customers and frustrating for you. You need to keep them informed about their orders so there's no confusion or unexpected delays. 
  </p>
  <p>
With this extension, you'll never have to worry about keeping track of your split shipments again! It makes sure that each customer knows when their next shipment will arrive and allows them to get in touch with us if something goes wrong. We will proactively notify the customer via email and SMS to provide their Magento track order URL. This helps lower our support costs and increase customer satisfaction!

<h2>OMNICHANNEL SHIPMENT TRACKING SOFTWARE</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
If you have a multi-channel business, then you are probably aware of the fact that things can get complicated.
</p>
<p>
 This is where we come in! By using our software and services we help retailers to simplify their shipping process and provide better customer service. We make it possible for your customers to track orders from any channel or device. 
</p>
<p>
 The solution for all of this is this Magento 2 integration which allows you to connect your online store with your shipping software without further configuration required on the merchant side. 
</p>
<p>
Now when a customer buys something from an external channel, they will be able to track their order in real-time through the integrated tracking links delivered directly into Magento 2 as soon as the shipment has been confirmed by UPS/FedEx/USPS, etc. With this feature, there is no need for reshipments that never reach their destination because those customers won’t even know about it! 
</p>
<p>
Also, it can happen that the Point of Sale (POS) system in stores is not connected back to Magento. When this happens, "Buy in Store, Ship to Home" orders go through but there will be no way for them to be checked up on. This is a detail that you should consider!
</p>
<p>
We take all of your orders from the website, apps, marketplaces, POS, and WMS to ensure that they can be seen together.

<h2>DECREASE CUSTOMER SERVICE COST & WISMO CALLS WHILE IMPROVING THE SERVICE.</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
   The most common problem is that customer service reps are overloaded with calls and your company can’t keep up.
  </p>
  <p>
The holiday season is the most demanding time of year for customer service reps; they can handle extra phone calls without a problem when hiring some more staff.
</p>
<p>
You already know that this is when your company should be on the hunt for cost-reducing solutions. You can either find ways to reduce costs or make up for any increases by upping advertising, raising customer service standards, or investing in better security procedures to stop everything from getting stolen.
  </p>
  <p>
Our solution made it possible for customers to reduce the cost of customer support calls, which was true customer service and cost-benefit analysis. This in turn enabled them to increase revenue by re-engaging with new or returning customers after they make their initial purchase.

<h2>DRIVE MORE SALES FROM YOUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS.</h2>

  <p>
  Many people stop shopping as soon as they complete a transaction. Fortunately, this is your best opportunity to re-engage them! This gives you the chance to present similar items or offer further information about membership benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
Simply re-engage with your online customers by offering branded content within the Tracking Page or emails. This will increase and optimize revenue potential.

<h2>BRANDED TRACKING PAGE</h2>

<ul>
  <p>
It's interesting that shipping transactional emails have a 3x better open rate than marketing ones!
</p>
<p>
 Online shoppers love to track their packages, but most eCommerce platforms don't offer a way for customers to do this. Their only option is to check the tracking number on your website and try to find it on one of the 3rd party parcel services websites like UPS or USPS.
</p>
<p>
 This can be frustrating especially if they're not tech-savvy enough. They might end up calling you instead which would have been avoided if they could just see their order status page right away! 
</p>
<p>
Our Magento order tracking extension frees tons of potentially lost revenue!
</p>
<p>
You can customize both the Tracking Page and Email notifications with your brand - you display your own logo, brand colors, and styling. Additionally, there are multiple areas to promote new products or point to trending categories on-site in an attempt to make customers aware of items they may need that will complement their order.
</p>
<p>
It also allows customers to easily track their orders from anywhere. At home, work, or even while they are out shopping again! All they need is an internet connection and a smartphone with text messaging capability. With our SMS notifications feature, you can send them updates when there's an update about their package delivery status.
</p>
<p>
When customers track their orders via SMS, a tracking link takes them back to the tracking page. This could also generate upsells for your eCommerce store!

<h2>MAGENTO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION - CSAT SURVEYS.</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
   We make it easy for you to survey your customers! CSAT surveys tools work by utilizing a simple, easy-to-use one star rating system with a written comment.
  </p>
  <p>
Our solution allows you to track back the low ratings and bad comments to the exact shipment that caused it. This allows you to find out which factor actually caused your reviews, whether it's an issue with how long it takes for a product to arrive or what customers think of the quality once they've received their order.
</p>
<p>
 To improve your customer order flow, you need to first understand why there are complaints against certain products or orders.
</p>
<p>
One of the most challenging parts about managing customer feedback can often be trying to find it all in one place.

<h2>HOW TO UPGRADE THE EXTENSION.</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
    Step 1. Remove extension code under app/code/WeSupply/Toolbox before adding the new extension files. The extension may be refactored and old unused files may cause random issues so it's best to only keep the latest version of the files.

  <p>
    Step 2. Follow normal installation instructions above.
